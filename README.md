# ❤️ **Heart Disease Prediction System**

A **machine learning-based prediction system** that analyzes patient data to assess the likelihood of heart disease. This project utilizes supervised learning models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**, along with **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **visualizations** to gain medical insights.

<br/>

## 📌 **Project Highlights**

- 🧠 Predicts presence of heart disease using clinical attributes  
- 📊 Performs in-depth data visualization and correlation analysis  
- 🤖 Implements multiple ML models for evaluation  
- ⚙️ Built in Jupyter Notebook, modular and beginner-friendly  

<br/>

## 🧾 **Dataset Source**

The dataset used is the **Heart Disease Dataset**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). It contains 303 records with 14 health-related attributes used to predict heart disease.

<br/>

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – for data handling  
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** – for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building and evaluation
